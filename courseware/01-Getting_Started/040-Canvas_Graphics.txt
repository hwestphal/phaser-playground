<lesson>02-Canvas Graphics
<shortdesc>We are going to create some simple graphics using Canvas.


<Title>Canvas Graphics
<p>Painters splash their paints onto a ^canvas^ to create designs.  That's a good way to think about what we are about to do.  There is a canvas on this web page, and we are going to draw on it.
<p>The following bit of code has two parts. The first part reaches into the webpage to find 


<code>
const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas') as HTMLCanvasElement
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.rect(0, 0, 256,256);
ctx.fill();
