<p(h1)> 1.1 Functions and Function Notation




<p(h2)>Relation definition
 

A relation between two sets is a collection of ordered pairs containing one object from each set. If the object x is from the first set and the object y is from the second set, then the objects are said to be related if the ordered pair (x,y) is in the relation.




<p(h2)>What is a Function?

<p>The world is full of relationships between quantities that change. When we see
these relationships, it is natural for us to ask “If I know one quantity, can I then determine
the other?” 

<p>This is the idea of a ^function^ in which the ^output^ can be determined from the ^input^. There is an input quantity, or independent variable, and a corresponding output quantity, or dependent variable. 



<p>A ^math function^ is a rule for a relationship between one or more ^inputs^, or independent, quantities and an ^output^, or dependent, quantity in which each input value uniquely determines one output value. We say “the output is a function of the input.”

<p(science)>
<p>Math functions represent #what is# knowledge. Programming functions are a bit different, they represent #how to# knowledge. 
<p>Some programming languages are very strict about what they allow in ^functions^, but JavaScript is not.  So we are sometimes going to show you things in JavaScript that you cannot do in your Math class.



<break>
<p(img=machine.png)>Think of a ^function^ as a machine.  You feed the input at one end, and it spits the output at the other end.



<p>Not all relationships can be represented by a function machine.  Only relationships where the output is predicted by the input are ^functions^.

<p(img=ageheight.jpg)>Some relationships between quantities are one-way, like height and age. At a certain age, you were a certain height.   Given your age, I could look up your height at that age.  
<p>But I would not be able to reverse that and look up your age when you were a given height.




















<break>
<p(h2)>Example 1
<p>In the example above, is height a function of age? Is age a function of height?  Both? Neither?
<p>Height is a function of age, since age uniquely determines a height. For example, on my 18th birthday, I was exactly 68 inches tall.
<p>However, age is not a function of height, since one height input might correspond with
more than one output age. For example, there is more
than one output of age since I was 70 inches at the age of 20 and 21.  If I 









<break>
<p(h2)>Example 2
<p>At a coffee shop, the menu consists of items and their prices. Is price a function of the
item? Is the item a function of the price?  Both? Neither?

<p>The price is a function of the item, since each input of an item has one output of a price corresponding to it.  The item is #not# a function of price, since two items might have the same price


<break>
<p(h2)>Example 3
<p>In many classes the percentage you earn in the course (say 80%) corresponds to the sum of your assignment marks (say 450 points). Is the sum number a function of percentage? Is percentage a function of decimal grade? Or both?

<p>For any percentage earned, there would be a sum number associated, so we could say that the sum number is a function of percentage. That is, if you input the percentage, your output would be a sum number. 

<p>Your percentage may or may not be a function of your
sum number grade, depending upon the teacher’s grading scheme. With some grading
systems, there is a range of percentages that correspond to the same decimal grade.









<break>
<p(science,h2)>One-to-One Relationships
<p>Sometimes in a relationship each input corresponds to exactly one output, and every output corresponds to exactly one input. We call this kind of relationship a ^one-to-one function^.

<break>
<p>In Example 3, if each unique percentage corresponds to one unique decimal grade
point and each unique decimal grade point corresponds to one unique percentage then it is a one-to-one function.  

<p>This might happen because the teacher designed the assignments and tests so that the unique decimal number sum was 100 and so each student's decimal number was identical to their percentage.




<p(h3)>Try it Now
<p>Let’s consider bank account information.
<p>1. Is your balance a function of your bank account number?
(if you input a bank account number does it make sense that the output is your balance?)
<p>2. Is your bank account number a function of your balance?
(if you input a balance does it make sense that the output is your bank account number?)





<p(h2)>Function Notation
<p>To simplify writing out expressions and equations involving functions, a simplified notation is often used. We also use descriptive variables to help us remember the meaning of the quantities in the problem.

<p>Rather than write “height is a function of age”, we could use the descriptive variable #h# to represent height and we could use the descriptive variable #a# to represent age.  

<asciimath>h = f(a)

<p>Remember the teacher who had a numeric score to convert to a percentage mark.  Let's assume that the maximum score of all the tests, assignments, mid-term, and attendance marks was 450.  To get the percentage mark #m#, we divide the score by #s# 4.5 and then round down to the nearest integer (the square bracket with the feet).

<asciimath>f(s) = |__  s / 4.5  __|



<p(h2)>JavaScript Functions
<p>Programming ^functions^ have to provide the #how to#.  


<code(norun)>
let mark = (score) => score / 4.5 | 0

<p>The brackets and #fat arrow# tell us that we are defining a function with an input called `score`.  We divide that score by 4.5 and then truncate the result to get an integer (otherwise we will have marks like 75.3333333333333). 

<p>
<code>
let m = (score:number) => score / 4.5 | 0

console.log(mark(355))


if we name the function f we write
or more simply
we could instead name the function h and write
which is read “h of a”
Remember we can use any variable to name the function; the notation h(a) shows us that
h depends on a. The value “a” must be put into the function “h” to get a result. Be
careful - the parentheses indicate that age is input into the function (Note: do not confuse
these parentheses with multiplication!).
Function Notation
The notation output = f(input) defines a function named f. This would be read “output
is f of input”
