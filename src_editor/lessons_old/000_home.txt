<title>GameCode JavaScript Camp

<p>Welcome.

<img>images/phaser.png
<p>We are going to be writing games in [<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>|JavaScript], using the [<a href="https://phaser.io/" target="_blank" >Phaser</a>|Phaser] game engine.
<p>Many 'Learn to Code' camps use visual "toy" languages like Scratch or [GameMaker|Game Maker].  We believe that young programmers are capable of much more.  We find passion and energy in **Making Great Things**, but that requires real tools and real learning.
<p>JavaScript is embedded in devices around you, and running every webpage you visit,  Phaser is the leading 2-D game engine, used by thousands of developers,  These are both complicated tools. Learning to use them requires work, practice, iterations, and time.
<br>
<p>We are a **Community of Learners**.  We are not a day-care or an after-school program. We learn at our own pace, following our own interests, choosing our own projects, for our own reasons.  We learn from each other, and teach each other. We collaborate on projects, we follow our curiosity, and we experiment with new ideas.
<p>When you have reached the end of our lessons, you will be ready to join the worldwide community of JavaScript programmers and game developers.  You will have the skills and confidence to continue learning with them. And of course, you will have written some awesome games.
<br>
<p>You are a Beginner until you write your first game.   You will start with the  Beginner lessons, which you can work through at your own pace.  At the end of each lesson, you must demonstrate your skills to a Proctor (who may be a student a few weeks ahead of you), in order to access the next lesson. 
<p>We have community groups that look like Facebook groups, but we don’t serve up ads or sell your information.  The groups let you keep in touch with your programmer friends, make new friends, and show off your work.  You start as a member of the Beginner group, and you gain access to other groups as you progress.  Check in often, let us know that you are moving forward. And please check in on your friends, to keep THEM moving forward.
<p>Create an account on the right, and then you will see the ‘Learn’ and ‘Share’ buttons. Explore.  Set up your profile, upload a photo of yourself.  Say Hi!
Feel free to invite your real-world friends.  Everything is totally free. 
<br>
<p>Serious programmers use SLACK for collaborating on projects, sharing documents, peer support, and one-to-one chats (both text and video).  We are programmers, and we are going to do all those things.  Click on the SLACK button on the right and join our channel.
<br>
<p>These are very early days.  So you are likely to find lots of errors and see many things we can improve.  Please let me know about them (on SLACK)
